# 🧱 Workbook 4: Object-Oriented Programming in Java  

Welcome to **Workbook 4** — your gateway to truly thinking *in objects*!  
From class creation to method overloading, unit testing to static design, this workbook is your complete guide to mastering core **OOP principles** in Java.  
Let’s build, test, and *slay* those class hierarchies. 💅

## 💡 Core Concepts

- 🔒 **Encapsulation** — Hides internal object details and protects data through access modifiers and method interfaces.  
- 🧱 **Class Design** — Organizes code into reusable blueprints that represent real-world entities or behaviors.  
- 🔁 **Method Overloading** — Allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, enabling flexible behavior.  
- 🧪 **Unit Testing** — Verifies the correctness of individual units of code (like methods) to ensure reliability and reduce bugs.  
- 🧷 **Static Members** — Provides shared methods or variables across all instances of a class without requiring object creation.  
- 🔗 **Class Interaction (Composition)** — Builds complex systems by enabling objects to contain or communicate with other objects.  
- 🔍 **Abstraction** — Simplifies complexity by defining essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary implementation details.
